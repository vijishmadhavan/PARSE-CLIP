# PARSE-CLIP

A simple CLIP based project for combining images from multiple datasets. This has been very helpful for me, hope it helps others as well.

**Colab:** [<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" align="center">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vijishmadhavan/PARSE-CLIP/blob/master/PARSE_CLIP.ipynb)

## What can PARSE-PIC do?

### - Combine Images from multiple datasets to create a new dataset.

#### Search Query - Specs

### - Move Images to a new folder/drive and start training.


## Limitations

- It might struggle with huge datasets.
- Colab free version will be slow.
- We should have some idea about the dataset, random search wont work.
- Have tried it only on Kaggle datasets.
